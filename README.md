# demnets

Digital Elevation Model Networks (demnets) are directed
networks in three-dimensional space that represent an
approximation of surface and sub-surface flows on the
modeled landscape of a given digital elevation model (DEM).
Topographic measures like total drainage area, specific
drainage area, slope and curvature are estimated by
corresponding network measures.
